	<p>Hi there! I'm a senior at Del Norte High School, based in San Diego, California. I'm currently a summer intern at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.</p>
	<p>I'm interested in neurobiology, behavioral economics, and cognitive science. I play competitive soccer for Nott's Forest Football Club, and I volunteer at YALLA SD, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping refugees get into college.</p> 
	<p>Scroll down to take a look at some of my projects.</p>
